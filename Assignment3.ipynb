    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\tThe basic advantage of functions is reusability of code. Instead of writing long codes we can made it modular .This can help to reduce code length finally saves memory and storage. It can help to run programs fastly. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "Always a function runs when we call it any where in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Def function()…which defines a function….\n",
    "Eg.. def bacon():  is the syntax  of a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Def  bacon():\n",
    "\tPrint(“Hello”)\n",
    "Bacon()\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are calling above function bacon() at the bottom line\n",
    " \n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Def function()…which defines a function….\n",
    "Eg.. def bacon():  is the syntax  of a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Def  bacon(): \n",
    "\tPrint(“Hello”)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a function we need to use def and function name with () any by passing a parameters in between parathesis or empty. Then colon(:). This is the format of a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Def function()…which defines a function….\n",
    "Eg.. def bacon():  is the syntax  of a function\n",

    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables defined outside a function is called as global scope variable..  generally we use global keyword for this. If a variable defined inside a function is called as local variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 types of variables\n",
    "1.\tGlobal variable\n",
    "2.\tLocal variable…. Private variable\n",
    "3.\tProtected variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tWe can not call a local variable from outside of a function. When we define a function variable inside a function that variable is local variable to that function by default. So when we call return that value we need to assign that value through the function parameter outside the function.\n",
    "Eg..\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_fun():\n",
    "    local_var = 10\n",

    "  \n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "The main purpose of return value is what ever the code we have written is to be executed and we use return that value to outside the function for further use. Second in an expression we can have return value.\n",

    "\n",
    "print(\"SUM outside function is::\", return_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "# if we observe inside function sum is local variable has calculated actual value .  \n",
    "#when we called the function outside the same value of sum is stored in return_value\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer is NONE.  \n",

    "def my_fun(a,b):\n",
    "    sum = a+b # here a=3 b=5\n",

    "# if we observe inside function sum is local variable has calculated actual value .  \n",
    "#when we called the function outside the same value of sum is not stored in return_value. Because no return in function\n",

    "\n",
    "Using global keyword..\n",
    "def my_fun(a,b):\n",
    "    global sum\n",
    "    sum = a+b # here a=3 b=5\n",

    "\n",
    "We use try and exception .. instead of loosing out of our control we use try and exception, so except catches the error value.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Try clause used execute a statement or expression, whenever there s an error occurs we use exception clause to handle that error to protect system from crash. All the errors in try clause are handled by exception by certain predefined errors like ValueError etc..\n",
