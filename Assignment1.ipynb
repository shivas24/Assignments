1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*   is expression or variable operator according to the given data
A	=	10          a1	=	A*3	=30
A	=	‘Hi’	a2	=	A*3	=HiHiHi
'hello'	= value
-87.8	=value
- 	=expression
/ 	=expression
+	=expression
6 	=value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
String is a data type in python. Variable is a storage container, which stores the assigned data type either be integer, float or string or Boolean.  
Name= ”Shivaprrasad”    #Here Name is string data type
Value=5		     #Value is variable which stores any value		

3. Describe three different data types.
In python there are several data types like 
Integers =to  represent integers to represent integer values
Float	= to represent with decimal values
Strings	=	to 	represent text values
Lists= to represent set of integer , float or strings
Other data types also like tuple, dictionary, sets  etc..

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
An expression is used to operate some set of calculations or a code to produce an output value .it can be used to perform the some set of operations and new value be assigned to new variable,

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Here we are assigning the value 10 to a variable spam.  
Spam =10        # expression
Spam=spam *3 #Expression
Print(spam)	# Statement
Expressions produce a value where as statement to perform an action, it may not produce value

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
print(bacon) = 22 only. Because after adding 1 to bacon i.e   22+1=23 is not reassigned to bacon. hence output will be 22
bacon = bacon +1 or  
bacon += 1

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
Answer1 = spamspamspam
Answer2= spamspamspam
Here *  can be used as an expression sometimes or can be used as an statement


8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Variables can not start or assigned with numeric values like
Eggs = 10  right
 100=10  wrong  ..in python variable cannot start with numeric
Like wise variable cant be eg..My Eggs=10  wrong.no space
10Eggs	=100 is  wrong.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Int()   = int(10.2)= 10
Float()	= Float(12)	=12.0
Str()	=str(10)	=’10’

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + 'burritos'
It can concatenate string only. 
To overcome this error we can use this expression.
'I have eaten'+'99'+'burritos'
‘Ihaveeaten’+str(99)+’burritos’
