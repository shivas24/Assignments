    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "*   is expression or variable operator according to the given data\n",
    "A\t=\t10          a1\t=\tA*3\t=30\n",

    "String is a data type in python. Variable is a storage container, which stores the assigned data type either be integer, float or string or Boolean.  \n",
